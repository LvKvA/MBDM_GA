### Final policy notebook
To reproduce the results from our project run final_policy.ipynb. 
The repository includes the results from previous runs, that were used to generate the graphs in the report. 
If you would like to generate new results, please uncomment the lines saving new outcomes.   
The repository includes our custom version of the dike model and problem formulation. This is imported automatically in the notebook, therefore only the notebook is required to reproduce our results. 

### Requirements
All imports are included in the first cell of the notebook. It requires the following external packages:
- Numpy 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn 
- EMA_workbench
- SALib.analyze
